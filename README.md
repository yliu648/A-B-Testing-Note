  Take action by making changes to product/features/offerings to eliminate the pain points you identified.
- Empathize with users: Build better communication channels with your users.
- Predict future behavior: Find behavior metrics (e.g., engagement and usage) useful for identifying churn and making a churn risk prediction for each paid user.
- Interventions for users: Segment paid users by churn risk and apply corresponding interventions to each segment in the early stages.
- Forward-looking strategies: Increase opportunities for upselling (the practice of selling a larger package) and 
  cross-selling (act of selling customers additional related products).
