### Timely Metrics:
For a SaaS business, by the time a user has churned, it’s too late — resurrecting a churned user is hard and acquiring a new one is costly. 
The more timely metrics to predict churn ahead of time:

- Number of sessions per day
- Time per session
Note that Time per session isn't a KPI for SaaS for predicting churn.

It’s hard for a SaaS business to stay in business with a high churn rate. Below are the measures that can be taken to reduce churn:

  Take action by making changes to product/features/offerings to eliminate the pain points you identified.
- Empathize with users: Build better communication channels with your users.
- Predict future behavior: Find behavior metrics (e.g., engagement and usage) useful for identifying churn and making a churn risk prediction for each paid user.
- Interventions for users: Segment paid users by churn risk and apply corresponding interventions to each segment in the early stages.
- Forward-looking strategies: Increase opportunities for upselling (the practice of selling a larger package) and 
  cross-selling (act of selling customers additional related products).

- What’s possible within the company’s current capabilities?
- What other alternatives could be provided to improve customer support?
